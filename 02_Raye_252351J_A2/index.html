                <h3 class="section-title">What is Volleyball?</h3>
                <p>
                    Volleyball is a <span class="highlight">dynamic team sport</span> played by two teams of
                    six players on a rectangular court divided by a net. The main objective is to send
                    the ball over the net and land it in the opponent's court, while preventing the
                    opponent from doing the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each team is allowed up to <span class="highlight">three touches</span> to return the ball,
                    typically consisting of a bump (pass), set, and spike (attack). This creates a
                    fast-paced, strategic game that requires excellent teamwork and communication.
                </p>

            <div class="intro-section">
                <h3 class="section-title">History & Origins</h3>
                <p>
                    Volleyball was invented in <span class="highlight">
                        1895 by William G. Morgan</span> in
                    Holyoke, Massachusetts, United States. Originally
                    called "Mintonette," it was designed
                    as a blend of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Morgan created the game for businessmen who found basketball
                    too vigorous. Since its humble beginnings, volleyball has
                    grown into a <span class="highlight">global phenomenon</span>
                    ,played indoors and on beaches, with professional leagues
                    worldwide and Olympic competition since 1964.

                <h3 class="section-title">Why Play Volleyball?</h3>
                <p>
                    The game emphasizes <span class="highlight">
                        teamwork, agility, coordination, and communication</span>,
                    making it both physically challenging and mentally engaging.
                    Unlike many sports, volleyball requires every player to
                    be involved in both offense and defense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're spiking at the net, diving for a dig,
                    or setting up the perfect play, volleyball offers an
                    exciting blend of athleticism and strategy that makes it
                    <span class="highlight">thrilling to both play and watch</span>.

                <h3 class="section-title">Basic Objective</h3>
                <p>
                    Two teams (usually 6 players each) compete to score points
                    by hitting the ball over the net and into the opposing
                    team's court.

                    A team scores when the opposing team:

                    Lets the ball land on their court.

                    Hits the ball out of bounds.

                    Fails to return the ball properly within 3 touches.

                <h3 class="section-title">Gameplay Rules</h3>
                <p>
                    Three touches max per side:
                    The ball can only be hit up to three times before it must go over the net.
                    Same player cannot hit twice in a row.

                    Legal hits include bump (forearm), set (fingertips), and spike (overhand attack).

                    No catching or holding the ball.

                    The ball must not touch the ground on your side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You lose the rally if:

                    Ball lands outside the court.

                    Ball hits the antenna (stick on the net).

                    Player touches the net.

                    Player crosses the centerline.

                    3 players at the front (near net): blockers and spikers.

                    3 players at the back: defensive players and servers.

                    Libero: a special back-row player (wears a different jersey,
                    cannot spike or serve in some leagues).

                <h3 class="section-title">Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>
                    A match is usually best of 5 sets.

                    To win a set:

                    Get 25 points (must lead by at least 2 points).

                    In the 5th set (if needed), teams play to 15 points.
